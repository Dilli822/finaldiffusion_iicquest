              The Hive Where Talents & Skill Thrive
            </Typography>
            Talented individuals in Nepal often lack exposure, trusted
            platforms, and access to the right opportunities. There's a gap in
            connecting talents directly with recruiters, mentors, or project
            hosts, leading to underused potential.
